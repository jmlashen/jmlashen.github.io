                    <p className="paragraphs">I find myself naturally drawn to the user experience and client-side. With my experiences in collaboration and leadership as an educator, I have always enjoyed the intrinsic rewards of helping others achieve their goals and overcome challenges.
                        The Nashville Software School's program challenged our small group to create the Cohort's website. We gained valuable experience learning the principles and processes of UI/UX. We even revealed a pain point in the School curriculum relating to graduation requirements during the process! From wireframes to prototypes, user testing, informational architecture, and visual hierarchyâ€“we got our hands dirty with every step.

                    <p className="paragraphs">My background in design comes from working as a freelance graphic designer. I mostly design album art for several musical artists, including Jason Wade, of Lifehouse.
                        Through these interactions, I have gained experience passionately working with clients to best represent their ideas with a finished product we can both be proud of. <b> <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.instagram.com/jake_diggity/?hl=en">Check out some of my artwork here.</a></b></p>
